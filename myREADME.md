# Bisbis10

## Overview

Bisbis10 is a web application designed to manage restaurants, dishes, orders, and ratings. It provides functionalities for adding, updating, and deleting restaurants and their corresponding dishes, as well as placing and managing orders and ratings.

## Bisbis10

- **Restaurant Management**: CRUD operations for restaurants, including name, average rating, and cuisines.
- **Dish Management**: CRUD operations for dishes, including name, description, and price.
- **Order Management**: Placing orders for dishes from restaurants.
- **Rating System**: Rating restaurants.

## Guiding Principles

- **Simplicity**: Keep the application simple and easy to use for both administrators and end-users.
- **Scalability**: Design the application to handle a growing number of restaurants, dishes, orders, and ratings efficiently.
- **Modularity**: Organize the codebase into modular components to facilitate maintenance and extensibility.
- **User Experience**: Prioritize user experience by implementing intuitive interfaces and providing helpful feedback.

## RESTful Architecture

Bisbis10 follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating scalable web services.

### Key Principles of REST, as implemented in Bisbis10:

- **Resource-based**: RESTful services expose resources (e.g., restaurants, dishes) that clients can interact with using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Uniform Interface**: Resources are accessed and manipulated using a uniform and standardized set of operations, making it easy to understand and use the API.
- **Stateless**: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests.

## Future Development

- **User Interface**: Create a User Interface.
- **User Management and Authentication**: Implement user management, authentication and authorization to secure the application and provide personalized experiences.
- **Expand Entity Functionality**: Save pictures for the dishes, more data on the restaurants such as verbal reviews.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Introduce reporting features to analyze restaurant performance, dish popularity, and customer behavior.
- **Map and Delivery**: Restaurant location and distance from user.
- **Integration with External Services**: Integrate with external services for features like online ordering, delivery tracking, or online reservations.
- **Mobile Application**: Develop a mobile application to complement the web application and provide access to users on-the-go.

## Styling

Bisbis10 embraces the Google Checks styling standards.
